# XCB Example 1: A Simple Window 

This is a example of creating a basic window that will close when escape
is pressed. It should be run from the terminal so that the information it
prints is visible.

> **NOTE** Do not close the window by pressing the X at the top right corner of
> the window. This will close the window but not the program. If you do this,
> press control-C to kill the program. This issue will be fixed in the next
> example.
