# Example 1 A Window

This is a simple example of creating a basic window that will close when escape
is pressed. It should be run from the terminal so that the information it
prints is visible.

> **NOTE** Do not close the window by press the X at the top right corner of the
> window. This will close the window but not the program. If you do this, press
> control-C to kill the program. This will be fixed in a different example.
