# Windows Example 1: A Simple Window 

 This is the first example for Windows. It creates a basic window with a specified background color. The window will close when escaspe is pressed. 

 As a bonus, this can also build cross-compiled under Linux for Windows by using the toolchain file located in the CMAKE directory. Once built, it will run perfectly find under Wine.
